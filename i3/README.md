My i3 config based on the one provided by Luke Smith.

i3-gaps
imagemagick and scrot (for the lock command)
pulseaudio (for screencast or audio capture; athough if you know how, you can easily change it to your alsa if that's all you use.)

Be also sure that the i3 folder is in your ~/.config directory.

Naturally be sure to replace whatever equivalent programs you have compared to the default ones that I use.

The GIMP window placement and the screenshot command settings will also need some tinkering depending on your resolution.
